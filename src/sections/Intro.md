# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Hi, I am Re (pronounced like Ray). I work at AWS as a Principal Solutions Architect where I spend my days designing resilient systems that scale.

In my free time, I'm fascinated by another kind of system: the psychological ones that shape how we love, hurt, and heal.

I look for patterns wherever I can find themâ€”in distributed architectures, family dynamics, and the gap between words and meaning. I like to read for insight into human nature, dance (poorly) to reggaeton songs, and write about whatever catches my attention. I write to learn. My writing explores both the architecture of software and the architecture of transformation.

Living beneath the tall evergreens in Washington State has taught me that building a peaceful family is harderâ€”and more rewardingâ€”than building any system.

I've written a book about building ML systems on Kubernetes. It isÂ [available for purchase on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQ4BFHLV)and alsoÂ [open sourced for free on GitHub](https://github.com/mlops-on-kubernetes/Book).
